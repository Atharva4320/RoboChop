# SAM + ChatGPT for Kitchen Tasks

With the development of foundational models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), as well as the advancements of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, there is a large untapped potential of leveraging these models for robotics applications. ChatGPT inherently holds significant cultural knowledge about how the world works, that can be very helpful when planning how to achieve a high-level goal.


## Project Goals:
-  Use YOLO fruit classification model to get the bounding box of the fruit.
- Get the coordinates of the bbox. and use them for prompt based SAM (talk more with Alison about this) to accurately segment the fruit and get the centroid. 
- Output the segmentation.



#### Long Term Goals:
    - May: Get SAM working, SAM is correctly able to segment the object of interest from its surrounding (Final test: presenting 2 objects that are similar and SAM is able to segment it properly)
    - June: Get ChatGPT working, ChatGPT is able to give accurate instructions to the robot based on the prompt
    - July: Robot is able to correctly implement ChatGPTâ€™s instructions without any error. 
    - August: Combine all the parts and create a pipeline so that all the previous steps are gettin executed seamlessly.

#### Short Term Goals:
    - May:
        - Week 1: Get the camera feed to display the scene (either on my computer or lab computer) and save the video.
        - Week 2: Implement SAM model, check if it is able to segment the apple from its surroundings. 
        - Week 3: Integrate YOLO and SAM to accurately segment the fruit
        - Week 4: Cut the apple in the scene, SAM should be able to detect the apple being cut and give how many pieces there are (* need to figure it out)
        - Week 4.5: If successful, SAM is able to segment the apple from its surrounding, get the centroid of the apple, pass the centroid coordinates to the robot, implement blind Z - direction action to cut the apple (maybe measure the force it took to pass the blade through apple). Potentially ChatGPT can be used to get the force required to cut apple (may have to give possible dimensions of the knife).
